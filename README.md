# Customer Score Analysis for Credit Classification

This project started as part of an "Hashtag Treinamentos" course. However, I made some modifications and improvements to the code, including:

- **Displaying feature importance in percentage**: I enhanced the project by calculating and displaying the importance of each feature in predicting customer credit eligibility
as a percentage, allowing for better interpretability and understanding of which features impact the predictions the most.
  
- **Implemented data visualization**: I used the matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries to create visualizations,
including bar charts and feature importance plots. These graphs help to visually communicate the results of the analysis and provide insights into the data, making the findings easier to understand.

These changes reflect my understanding and application of machine learning concepts, as well as my effort to improve the modelâ€™s usability and interpretability.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

1. **Build classification models**: Implement several classification algorithms to predict whether a customer is a "good" or "bad" client based on their score and other features.
2. **Evaluate model performance**: Compare the performance of different models to find the best one for this particular use case.

## Features

The dataset consists of various features that are relevant to determining a customer's score and eligibility for banking benefits. These features might include, but are not limited to:

- **Age**: The customer's age.
- **Income**: The annual income of the customer.
- **Credit History**: A measure of the customer's past credit behavior.
- **Existing Loans**: Whether the customer currently has any loans.
- **Monthly Expenses**: The customer's monthly expenses.
- **Current Score**: The current score assigned to the customer, which is used to determine their eligibility for loans, credit, and other benefits.
